##  Abstract 

A mutually agreed upon single-source-of-truth in any Product Life Cycle chain would allow stakeholders to bypass the need for costly human intervention and thus save time and money. If Party A and Party B can establish a consenus about the state of a product, many previously time-consuming and error-prone processes can be optimized (and even automated).  An oracle based on immutable digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if human beings are still required to verify product state. We provide a solution by using a combination of decentralized and traditional cloud-based technologies.  

## Pairing a Digital Identity with a physical or virtual item.

Brands can use our cloud application/API to create digital identities and apply them to packaging or products.  Our solution offers a simple way to pair a physical or virtual item (whether it be a vaccine kit or a plot of land) with an immutable, irrefutable and universally accepted digital identity.  The benefits of this digital identity can be felt throughout the entire Product Life Cycle from the OEM to logistics to end-user customer support. By storing data on IPFS and storing cryptographic hashes on the Blockchain, we are able to build consensus and trust between stakeholders regarding the state and location of any physical or virtual item.  

## Our Toolset

We offer a suite of tools that allow any manufacturer or producer to quickly and inexpensively build digital identities, pair them with physical or virtual items, and create attestations about these items.  Our toolset is designed to be complementary to existing systems and does not require specialized or expensive hardware.  Brands start by creating a digital identity for the products they sell.
