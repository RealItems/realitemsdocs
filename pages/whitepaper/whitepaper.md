##  Abstract 

A mutually agreed upon single source of truth in any Product Life Cycle chain would allow stakeholders to bypass the need for costly human intervention and thus save time and money. If Party A and Party B can establish a consenus about the state of a product, many previously time-consuming and error-prone processes can be optimized, removed or automated.  We use a combination of decentralized and traditional cloud-based technologies to establish trust between stakeholders.  At the core of our technology is a Distributed Ledger Technology which uses immutable digital signatures to verify product state.

## Pairing a Digital Identity with a physical or virtual item.

Brands can use our toolset to create digital identities and write them to the Blockchain.  Once created, each digital identity can be applied to packaging or products.  Our solution offers a simple way to pair a physical or virtual item (whether it be a vaccine kit or a plot of land) with an immutable, irrefutable and universally accepted digital identity.  The benefits of this digital identity can be felt throughout the entire Product Life Cycle from the OEMs to logistics providers to the end-user. By storing data on IPFS and storing cryptographic hashes on the Blockchain, we are able to build consensus and trust between stakeholders regarding the state and location of any physical or virtual item.  

## Keeping Transaction Costs Down 

Gas costs, the price of a blockchain transaction, is a problem that plagues many smart contract platforms.  Ethereum, in particular, suffers from this problem.  The more popular the network becomes, the higher the value of their token (Ether) rises.  As their token rises and falls so to transaction costs, making the platform prohibitively expensive for many applications.  High and/or volatile gas costs make it difficult for a business to extrapolate profits. 

Our solution to this problem is two-fold.  

First, we chose a core Blockchain technology that has already solved the transaction cost volatility problem. VeChain solves this by implementing a dual-token system - VET for currency and VTHO for gas. VET is used as the medium of exchange and store of value while VTHO is used to pay for transactions.  These two tokens are loosely-coupled and are controlled by its **velocity**, the rate at which it is generated from VET.  Unlike Ethereum, the price of the cryptocurrency can rise and fall while transaction costs remain relatively stable.

Second, we have integrated the mechanism of **batching** into our core technology.  Built into our system is ability to shard digital identities from the same digital signature.  For non-durable goods, such as a can of soda or a bottle of ointment, we can create a Non Fungible Record using a single digital signature, and then subdivide it into multiple digital identities.  The number of digital identities derived from the NFR depends on the life span and use of a particular product.

## Primary Functionality ##

* Creation

## Our Toolset

We offer a suite of tools that allow any manufacturer or producer to quickly and inexpensively build digital identities, pair them with physical or virtual items, and create attestations about these items.  Our toolset is designed to be complementary to existing systems and does not require specialized or expensive hardware.  Brands start by creating a digital identity for the products they sell.
