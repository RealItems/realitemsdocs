## View Your Portfolio

To view the items in your _portfolio_:

* Log in to (or create) your CP3 account
* Click on the ***Portfolio*** button on the bottom navigation bar

You should now see all of the items in your _portfolio_.  If you don't see any items you probably have not taken ownership of any items yet therefore your portfolio is empty.

## Searching For Items

If you have many items in your portfolio you can search your items by typing any keyword into the **Search your assets** text box.  The list of items will dynamically update based on the search term you use.
