## Digital Identities and Authenticity

Verifying the authenticity of an item means ensuring that the digital identity and PIN matches the item.   This is usually done by scanning the QR code on an item and then providing in the accompanying PIN.  After the  verification process is completed successfully, you can be sure the item is authentic.

## Finding the QR Code

The QR Code for an item can be found:

* On the outside of the item
* On the outside of the packaging
* Inside the packaging on a receipt

## Scanning the QR Code

There are two ways to scan the QR Code:

### Stock Camera

* Open the stock camera program on your Android or IOS phone
* Point it at the QR Code
* Click on the link when prompted
* The item will load

### CP3 Camera

* Log in to CP3 with your username and password
* Point it at the QR Code
* The item will load

## Finding the PIN

The PIN is an alphanumeric string that is 6 characters in length.

The PIN of an item can be found:

* On the outside of the item near the QR Code
* On the outside of the packaging near the QR Code
* Inside the packaging on a receipt

## Entering the PIN

After you scan the QR Code, click the link:

* Click on the **Enter PIN To Verify** button
* Enter the PIN into the text box
* Click the **All Set To Go** button

If the PIN is not valid you will see a message that says **Pin Is Invalid**

If the PIN is valid you will see a message that says either **This Item Is Authentic** or **This Item is already taken**.
