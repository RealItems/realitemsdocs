## Tracking Events 

A tracking event is a real-world event that is recorded on the blockchain. A tracking event represents something that has "happened" to the item.  Examples are "item shipped", "item received", "item sold", "video associated".  Not all digital IDs have tracking events but all tracking events have exactly one digital ID.

## Tracker App and Real Items API

Tracking events are created and written to the blockchain via the Tracker App or the Real Items API.
