## End Users 

The end users are the consumers who are the final destination of the items you create.  After an end user receives an item they may scan the QR code and validate it with the PIN.  Then they may opt to "take ownership" of the item, meaning their user ID and email address will be associated with that item and the end user will become "known" to your organization for customer support and possible marketing opportunities.


## Managing End Users

At this time TAM only allows administrators to read the users information and view the items for which they have taken ownership.  More end user features will be added as the product develops.
