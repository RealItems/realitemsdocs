## Digital Identities 

A **digital identity** (also referred to as an **item**) is an instance of a **product** that has been digitized on the blockchain.  A digital identity can be a single NFT on the blockchain (in the case of durable products), or a fraction of an NFT paired with a unique PIN.  Associated with each digital identity is a QR Code, a numeric ID, an obfuscated ID and a PIN.  Digital identities have a custodian (a program or human that holds the private key and/or the PIN) and are sometimes associated with an owner (a specific company or human being).  The custodian and the owner can be the same person or thing, or they can be different.

## Pairing you digital identity with a physical item.

To pair a digital identity with a physical item we will need to physically associate a unique QR code/PIN combination to that item.  Using the TAM, you can print out the QR code/PIN combination and apply it to the item or the box containing the item.

1. Go to Inventory page
