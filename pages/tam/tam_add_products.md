## Product Templates 

By creating product templates, you are telling the Real Items system which types of products can be digitized on the blockchain.  By stepping through and filling out the product template form, you create a product that is available for creation to the blockchain.  Product templates include, plain text, URLs, images, videos and documents.  Assets included in the templates (images, videos, etc.) are pushed to IPFS and are thereafter referenced via an IPFS-based URL.  

## What you need to create a new product template 

You will need 6 product images, a video, a Certificate of Authority, a recycling URL.

## After you have created a product template

After you create a product template you can create digital instances of that product on the blockchain by going to the Inventory service.
